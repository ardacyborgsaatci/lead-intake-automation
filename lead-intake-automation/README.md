# Lead Intake & Scoring Automation

A contact form on a custom website feeds an n8n workflow that scores each lead, logs it to Google Sheets, and emails the owner when a lead is hot.

## Architecture

```
Browser form (Vercel static page)
   │  POST /api/lead
   ▼
Vercel function  ── validates fields, drops honeypot spam
   │  POST + X-Lead-Secret header
   ▼
n8n Webhook ─→ Score Lead ─→ Save to Google Sheets ─→ Respond to Webhook ─→ Is Hot Lead? ─→ Gmail alert
```

Why a Vercel function sits in the middle: the n8n webhook URL and secret never reach the browser, no CORS setup is needed, and input checks live in one place.

## Scoring

| Signal | Points |
|---|---|
| Budget | $20k+ = 35, $5k–$20k = 25, $1k–$5k = 15, under $1k = 5 |
| Company size | 200+ = 20, 51–200 = 15, 11–50 = 10, 1–10 = 5 |
| Timeline | This month = 20, 1–3 months = 15, 3+ months = 5 |
| Business email (not gmail/yahoo/etc.) | 10 |

Tiers: **Hot** ≥ 70, **Warm** ≥ 40, otherwise **Cold**. Only Hot leads trigger the email.

## The website

The site is a one-page product site for **Brightline**, a fictional company that sells this lead-intake system to small businesses. The page shows the product it sells: a live-style enquiry list with scores, a diagram of the n8n workflow, plans and a FAQ, and the lead form at the end. The form on the page is the real one, so submitting it runs the whole pipeline above.

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Hero | What is sold, for whom, with an enquiry-list window showing real scoring |
| `#features`, `#alerts` | Lead scoring, the Google Sheets log, hot-lead alerts and spam checks |
| `#process` | The four steps from form to inbox, with the workflow diagram |
| `#pricing` | Setup and care plan (the prices are assumed for the demo) |
| `#faq` | Short answers, plus the scoring points table |
| `#brief` | The lead form |
| `/privacy`, `404` | Privacy note and error page |

The old multi-page URLs (`/services`, `/work`, `/about`, `/contact`) redirect to the matching sections (see `website/vercel.json`).

The look follows `DESIGN.md` (a Vercel-inspired system: near-white canvas, ink `#171717` as the one action colour, Geist and Geist Mono, pill buttons, hairline rings with stacked shadows, one ink band, a mesh gradient behind the hero window, and soft gradient washes behind each section). It is set in `website/design.css` on top of the taste-skill kit (`website/assets/`): no build step, no framework, three small scripts of the page's own (`contact.js` plus the kit's `system.js`, `motion.js` and `layout.js`). Brand icons (n8n, Vercel, Google Sheets, Gmail) are local SVG files in `website/assets/icons/`, fetched from pinned sources; they belong to their owners and only name tools the system really uses. Pages are marked `noindex` because the company is fictional; remove the `robots` meta tag from each page to allow indexing.

## Repository layout

```
workflow.json          n8n workflow (import into n8n)
DESIGN.md              the design system the site follows
website/
  index.html           the one-page site
  privacy.html, 404.html
  design.css           the DESIGN.md look: palette, type, buttons, cards, nav
  contact.js           form handling: inline errors, then POST /api/lead
  assets/              design kit (CSS, scripts, diagram engine) and icons/
  favicon.svg
  vercel.json          clean URLs and redirects from the old pages
  api/lead.js          Vercel function: validate, then forward to n8n
  lib/validate.js      field validation shared by the function and tests
  test/                unit tests and site checks (npm test)
```

## Setup

### 1. n8n

1. Import `workflow.json` (**Workflows → Import from File**).
2. **Save to Google Sheets**: connect a Google Sheets credential and replace `REPLACE_WITH_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` with your sheet's ID. The sheet needs a tab named `Leads` with this header row:
   `submittedAt | name | email | company | companySize | budget | timeline | message | businessEmail | score | tier`
3. **Send Hot Lead Email**: connect a Gmail credential and replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL`.
4. **Webhook**: create a **Header Auth** credential with name `X-Lead-Secret` and a long random value, and assign it to the node. Generate a value with:
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```
5. Publish the workflow. Copy the **production** URL from the Webhook node (`.../webhook/lead-intake`).

### 2. Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub and import it in Vercel, with **Root Directory** set to `website`.
2. Add environment variables:
   - `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`: the production webhook URL
   - `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: the same value as the Header Auth credential
3. Deploy.

## Testing

Run the unit tests locally:

```
cd website
npm test
```

Then submit these on the live site and check the sheet and your inbox:

| Test | Company size | Budget | Timeline | Email | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hot | 200+ | $20k+ | This month | you@yourcompany.com | Row added, email sent |
| Warm | 11–50 | $1k–$5k | 1–3 months | you@gmail.com | Row added, no email |
| Cold | 1–10 | Under $1k | 3+ months | you@gmail.com | Row added, no email |

Also confirm that a request without the secret header is rejected by n8n, and that a submission with the hidden `website` field filled adds no row.

## Possible extensions

- Add Cloudflare Turnstile for stronger spam protection.
- Send an auto-reply to the lead.
- Enrich the company domain with a company-data API.
- Add an n8n Error Trigger workflow for failure alerts.
